The software is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally intended as a graphical program which would allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data. Gnuplot supports many different types of terminals, plotters, and printers (including many color devices, and pseudo-devices like LaTeX) and is easily extensible to include new devices. [ The "GNU" in gnuplot is NOT related to the Free Software Foundation, the naming is just a coincidence (and a long story). Thus gnuplot is not covered by the Gnu copyleft, but rather by its own copyright statement, included in all source code files.]     Gnuplot handles both curves (2 dimensions) and surfaces (3 dimensions). Surfaces can be plotted as a mesh fitting the specified function, floating in the 3-d coordinate space, or as a contour plot on the x-y plane. For 2-d plots, there are also many plot styles, including lines, points, lines with points, error bars, and impulses (crude bar graphs). Graphs may be labeled with arbitrary labels and arrows, axes labels, a title, date and time, and a key. The interface includes command-line editing and history on most platforms.

KEY = systemd target
DEF = systemd replaces traditional SysVinit runlevels with predefined groups of units called targets. Targets are usually defined according to the intended use of the system, and ensure that required dependencies for that use are met. Fedora boots to the target described in /lib/systemd/system/default.target which is a symlink that can be changed when booting to a different target is desired. Appending systemd.unit=custom.target to the kernel's boot arguments will override the default target. Historically, those wishing to execute additional programs at boot could insert commands into /etc/rc.local. While systemd will use this file, writing unit files can be simple, effective, and much more flexible. Example Fedora unit file: cat /lib/systemd/system/example.service

Moreover, FFTW's performance is portable: the program will perform well on most architectures without modification.

In the simplest case of two input frequencies f1 and f2.  The output contains may contain component at the sum-frequency f1+f2 and difference-frequency f1-f2 (and f2-f1). Multiplying two sinusoids together and applying the trig identity cos(a+b) = cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b) can be used to illustrate this.

KEY = Pitch Shifter | Pitch Shifting
DEF = As opposed to the process of pitch transposition achieved using a simple sample rate conversion, Pitch Scaling is a way to change the pitch of a signal without changing its length. In practical applications, this is achieved by changing the length of a sound using one of the below methods and then performing a sample rate conversion to change the pitch. There exists a certain confusion in terminology, as Pitch Scaling is often also incorrectly named 'Pitch Shift' (a term coined by the music industry). A true Pitch Shift (as obtainable by modulating an analytic signal by a complex exponential) will shift the spectrum of a sound, while Pitch Scaling will dilate it, upholding the harmonic relationship of the sound. The actual Pitch Shifting yields a metallic, inharmonic sound which may well be an interesting special effect but which is a totally inadequate process for changing the pitch of any harmonic sound except a single sine wave.

Tools based on the MPEG-4 standard will be the future platform for computer music, audio for gaming, streaming Internet radio, and other multimedia applications. MPEG-4 Structured Audio and AudioBIFS are free standards created through the open standardization process and released into the public domain. They are completely free for anyone to us. This site is the best place to learn about these new developments in computer sound processing.

DEF = Every periodic signal has a <i>fundamental frequency</i> given by the <i>inverse</i> of the period.  If the period is in units of seconds, then the fundamental frequency is in units of Hertz (cycles per second).  According to Fourier theory, every periodic signal can be expressed as a sum of sinusoids at frequencies given by integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.  For integers greater than 1, these frequencies are called <i>harmonic frequencies</i>, and the sinusoids at harmonic frequencies are typically called <i>harmonics</i>.

DEF = A <i>force</i> is required to change the <i>momentum</i> of an object.  In the absence of external forces, momentum is conserved.  For a mass m in flight, the momentum is m v, where v denotes the velocity of the mass.  Newton's second law, F = m a, says that force equals mass times acceleration, i.e., force equals the time derivative of momentum.

# Moment is too generic: "At one moment we have ..."
KEY = Moment of Force | Force Moment
DEF = The <i>moment of force</i> in physics, or simply <i>moment</i>, is defined as an applied force times the distance of that force from an axis of rotation.  The force is applied perpendicular to the <i>moment arm</i>, which is the line from the axis of rotation to the point of force application. A moment is the same thing as <i>torque</i>, but the term torque is usually used for an externally applied twisting force (such as when pushing the end of a wrench to apply torque to a nut), while the term moment applies to rotational forces inside a solid resulting from stresses in the solid.  More generally, the stresses inside a solid at any given point may be expressed as a superposition of the net moment at that point (circular force at that point) plus <i>shear</i> stress.  (A shear force deforms a square region into a rhombus, or diamond shape.)

KEY = Difference Equation
DEF = The <i>difference equation</i> is a recipe for computing samples of the output signal of a digital filter based on samples of the input signal and the filter coefficients.  In an Infinite-Impulse-Response (IIR) digital filter, there are typically both feedforward and feedback coefficients in the difference equation.

KEY = Filter
DEF = A <i>filter</i> in the audio signal processing context is any operation that accepts a signal as an input and produces a signal as an output.  Most practical audio filters are <i>linear</i> and <i>time invariant</i>, in which case they can be characterized by their <i>impulse response</i> or their <i>frequency response</i>.

URL = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression

KEY = limiter
DEF = A <i>limiter</i> or "soft-clipper" is typically implemented as a dynamic range compressor set to a high threshold, high compression ratio, and fast attack time.  As a result, when a signal nears the clipping point (maximum amplitude level), the limiter quickly attenuates the signal to avoid hard clipping.
